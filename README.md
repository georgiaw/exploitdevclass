# exploitdevclass
Resources for my exploit development class 

Included here are the exploit skeletons and vulnerable software for the exploit development class I am releasing. The writeups of each module are on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/georgiaweidman. I may include them here as well at some later date. Also I am putting video walkthroughs up on my Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/georgiaweidman.

The skeletons are designed to allow the learner to focus on building the exploit string rather than learning Python. 

The vulnerable software has vulnerabilities, and should only be used for learning purposes on a host-only virtual machine.

Along with the 2nd edition of Penetration Testing: A Hands-On Introduction to Hacking, I am updating all my course material, so I decided to release the old, still very relevant exploit development for free. Please contact me georgia [at] bulbsecurity [dot] com if you want to use my work in your course. If it's free, I will say yes. It is paid we can have a conversation about it. 

Contributions from readers are what allow me to have the time to make community contributions like this. If you like it, please feel free to donate here, join my Patreon, book a 1 on 1 session on Topmate: https://topmate.io/georgia_weidman, join my bootcamp on GINI: https://gininow.com/pro/eXLxJ5bb2Rff5wF95fN6E5pyhH62 or hire me to pentest your company or product. 

Hope you enjoy and look out for the preorder link for Pentesting V2 coming soon.
